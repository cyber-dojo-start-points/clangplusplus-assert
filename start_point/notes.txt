I cannot add this line to the makefile
CXXFLAGS += -fsanitize=address

I investigated this and to get that to work I
had to alter the docker-container permissions
as set in the docker-runner. Specifically

o) I had to add this line to the docker run options
      --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE

o) I had to remove this line from the docker run options
      --ulimit data=4*GB

The reason is from the runner microservice which has this:

  def clang?(image_name)
    image_name.start_with?('cyberdojofoundation/clang')
  end

which needs to be updated to

  def clang?(image_name)
    image_name.start_with?('cyberdojofoundation/clang') ||
    image_name.start_with?('ghcr.io/cyber-dojo-languages/clang')
  end
