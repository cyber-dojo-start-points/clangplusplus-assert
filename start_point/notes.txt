I cannot add this line to the makefile
CXXFLAGS += -fsanitize=address

I investigated this and to get that to work I
had to alter the docker-container permissions
as set in the docker-runner. Specifically

o) I had to add this line to the docker run options
      --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE

o) I had to remove this line from the docker run options
      --ulimit data=4*GB
